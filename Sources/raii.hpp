    /*!
     RAII (Resource acquisition is initialization) is used to implement the RAII
     pattern without always having to create a custom class.

     You give this class two lambdas. The first is the setup code which is run
     by the class constructor. The second is the cleanup code which is run by the
     class destructor. Hence the RAII pattern, the setup runs when the object
     comes into scope and the cleanup when it goes out of scope.

     This is structured like the following:

     @code
     {
         RAII myRAII([]{
            cout << "this gets run at setup" << endl;
         }, []{
            cout << "this gets run at cleanup" << endl;
         });

         cout << "this is my application code" << endl;
     }
     @endcode

     This would produce the following output:

     @code
     this gets run at setup
     this is my application code
     this gets run at cleanup
     @endcode
